# Choroid plexus segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Studies of choroid plexus have recently gained attention. Given its role in CSF production, choroid plexus plays a crucial role in CSF-based clearance systems. Moreover, choroid plexus epithelium is lined with numerous transporters that transport various CSF proteins including Aβ to the blood. T1-weighted MRIs provide a non-invasive imaging technique to study the morphological characteristics of choroid plexus and also enable more advanced functional and perfusion imaging studies. Previous studies have used Freesurfer for automatic choroid plexus segmentation. Here, we present a lightweight algorithm that aims to improve choroid plexus segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). We tested the accuracy of the algorithm against manual segmentations as well as Freesurfer.

<h3> Required packages</h3>

* FSL
* Freesurfer
* Python: nibabel, sklearn, numpy 

<h3> How to run the code</h3>
The current version of the script requires Freesurfer processed files (recon-all) for ventricular segmentation. In future, we aim to add the possibility to use other ventricular segmentation algorithms to speed up the process. After running recon-all, you can get the choroid plexus segmentation as follows: 

In the terminal:
```bash
python run_gmm_chp_segmentation.py <freesurfer_subjects_dir> <subject_id>
```
The resulting choroid plexus segmentation can be found under `<freesurfer_subjects_dir>/<subject_id>/mri/choroid_susan_segmentation.nii.gz`
